    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: June 29, 2023</p>
    <h2>Welcome to TalktoLisa.com!</h2>
    <p>
        We’re so happy to have you here. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of our service and the software, content, and services offered through our website and our mobile apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please read these terms carefully before you start using the Services. By using the Services, you indicate that you accept these Terms and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree to these Terms, please refrain from using the services.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Our Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our service offers a virtual girlfriend with whom you can communicate through a text and voice interface. However, we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our Services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Service is not for emergencies. If you think you have a medical or mental health emergency, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest open clinic or emergency room.
    </p>
    <h2>2. Membership & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
        You will be required to register with our service and become a Member in order to access and use the Services. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you become a Member, you can choose one of the subscription programs offered: a free-of-charge program with limited access to the Services or a subscription-fee based program, which gives full access to the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any of our paid subscriptions shall be paid in monthly, semi-annual or annual installments. Should you fail to pay your subscription within 7 days after a due date, you will automatically downgrade to the free program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that if you purchase a subscription, the sale is final, and we will not provide a refund.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Cancellation of Services</h2>
    <p>
        You may cancel your Membership at any time by deleting your account in the app. This action is irreversible. As soon as you delete your account, all the data associated with your use of the Services will be removed permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may cancel a Paid Subscription and downgrade to the free program at any time without deleting your account. Cancellation is effective at the end of the applicable billing period.
    </p>
    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>
        You are responsible for your own communications and for any consequences thereof. The Service is for your personal use only. Unless otherwise expressly authorized herein or in the Services, you agree not to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce, duplicate, copy, create derivative works from, modify, sell, resell, exploit, transfer or upload for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Services, use of the Service.
